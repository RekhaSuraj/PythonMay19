# For Loop

# Looping statements - For loop
# In Python, the for loop is used to iterate over a sequence such as a list, string, tuple,
# other iterable objects such as range.
#
# With the help of for loop, we can iterate over each item present in the sequence and
# execute the same set of operations for each item.
# Using a for loops in Python we can automate and repeat tasks in an efficient manner.
#
# So the bottom line is using the for loop we can repeat the block of statements a fixed number
# of times.
# for loop :
# Iterables : list,string,tuple,set,dict,range,array

# default start value is 0
# range(start=num,stop=num,step=1)
x = range(1,11)
print(type(x))
print(x)
# <class 'range'>



# syntax : for var in iterable:
#               body of for loop


for var in range(1,11):
    print(var)
