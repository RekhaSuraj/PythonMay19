# Nested if

# Nested if-else statement
# In Python, the nested if-else statement is an if statement inside another if-else statement.
# It is allowed in Python to put any number of if statements in another if statement.
#
# Indentation is the only way to differentiate the level of nesting.
# The nested if-else is useful when we want to make a series of decisions.
#
