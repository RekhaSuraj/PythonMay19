# Inheritance:

# The process of inheriting the properties of the parent class into a child class is called inheritance.
# The existing class is called a base class or parent class and the new class is called a subclass or child class or derived class.

# In Object-oriented programming, inheritance is an important aspect.
# The main purpose of inheritance is the reusability of code because we can use the existing class to create a new class instead of creating
#  it from scratch.

# In inheritance, the child class acquires all the data members, properties, and functions from the parent class. Also,
# a child class can also provide its specific implementation to the methods of the parent class.

# Types Of Inheritance
# In Python, based upon the number of child and parent classes involved, there are five types of inheritance.

# The type of inheritance are listed below:

# Single inheritance
# Multiple Inheritance
# Multilevel inheritance
# Hierarchical Inheritance
# Hybrid Inheritance
# Now let’s see each in detail with an example.

# Single Inheritance
# In single inheritance, a child class inherits from a single-parent class. Here is one child class and one parent class.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Multiple Inheritance
# In multiple inheritance, one child class can inherit from multiple parent classes. So here is one child class and multiple parent classes.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Multilevel inheritance
# In multilevel inheritance, a class inherits from a child class or derived class. Suppose three classes A, B, C.
#  A is the superclass, B is the child class of A, C is the child class of B. In other words, we can say a chain of classes is called multilevel inheritance.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Hierarchical Inheritance
# In Hierarchical inheritance, more than one child class is derived from a single parent class.
# In other words, we can say one parent class and multiple child classes.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Hybrid Inheritance
# When inheritance is consists of multiple types or a combination of different inheritance is called hybrid inheritance.
