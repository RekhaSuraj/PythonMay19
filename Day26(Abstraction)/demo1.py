# Child class ---->  Triangle: Noofsides(3), Area, Perimeter
# Rectangle :   Noofside(4),Area, Perimeter 

# An abstract class can be considered as a blueprint for other classes.
# It allows you to create a set of methods that must be created within any child classes built from the abstract class.
# A class which contains one or more abstract methods is called an abstract class. 
# An abstract method is a method that has a declaration but does not have an implementation. 
# While we are designing large functional units we use an abstract class. 
# When we want to provide a common interface for different implementations of a component, we use an abstract class. 


# Why use Abstract Base Classes :
# By defining an abstract base class, you can define a common Application Program Interface(API) for a set of subclasses. 
# This capability is especially useful in situations where a third-party is going to provide implementations, 
# such as with plugins, but can also help you when working in a large team or with a large code-base 
# where keeping all classes in your mind is difficult or not possible. 

# How Abstract Base classes work : 
# By default, Python does not provide abstract classes.
#  Python comes with a module that provides the base for defining Abstract Base classes(ABC) and that module name is ABC.
#  ABC works by decorating methods of the base class as abstract and then registering concrete classes as 
# implementations of the abstract base. A method becomes abstract when decorated with the keyword @abstractmethod.

# we have to import from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
