# while loop:

# While loop : Iteration return till condition True, then iteration will be stop when condition becomes False
# while Condition:
#     Statement ...1


# while True:
#     print('Inside While loop, it will stop when condition becomes False')

#
# print('Outside of While loop')
# # Outside of While loop

# In simple words, The while loop enables the Python program to repeat a set of operations while a
# particular condition is true.
# When the condition becomes false, execution comes out of the loop immediately,
# and the first statement after the while loop is executed.

while x == True:
    print('Inside While loop, it will stop when condition becomes False')

print('Outside of While loop')
