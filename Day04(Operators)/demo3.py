# Assignment operator - 
# These are types - =, +=, -=,*=,/=,//=, %=, **=

# = (assigning a value to a variable)
a = 2
# This means 2 is assigned to a(variable)

# += (Increment and assign)
n1 = 4
n2 = 2
n1+n2

n1 = n1+1
print(n1)
# 5

n1 += 1 #(This is read as n1 = n1+1, which is n1 = 5+1, n1 = 6)
print(n1)
# 6

x = 4
x += 3
print(x)
# 7

# 2. Decrement operator (-=)
m = 10
m -= 2

print(m)
# 8

l = -5
l -= 3
print(l) 
# -8

# 3. Multiply and assign(*=) 
a = 5
a *= 6
print(a) #(a = a*6)

# 5. Floor division and assign(//=) 
f = 10
f //= 2
print(f)
# 5
