# Operator - We perform some operations on operands, we use operators:

# Ex: result = var1 + var2
# var1 and var2 are operands
# operation - Addition
# + is operator

# There are 7 built in operators in python
# 1. Arithmetic operators
# 2. Assignment operators
# 3. Logical operators
# 4. Comparison operators
# 5. Membership operators
# 6. Identity operators
# 7. Bitwise operators

# 1. Arithmetic operators - 
# 1. Addition(+)
# 2. Subtraction(-)
# 3. Multiplication(*)
# 4. Division(/)
# 5. Floor Division(//)
# 6. Modulus (%)
# 7. Exponentiation(**)

# 1. Addition - (+)
var1 = 10
var2 = 20
res = var1+var2
print('Addition:',res)
# Addition: 30

# 2. Subtraction(-)
v1 = 30
v2 = 10
res = v1-v2
print('Subtraction:',res)
# Subtraction: 20

# 3. Multiplication(*)
m1 = 10
m2 = 15
prod = m1*m2
print('Product:',prod)
# Product: 150

# 4. Division(/)
d1 = 50
d2 = 10
div = d1/d2
print('Division:',div)
# Result of division will always be in float format
# Division: 5.0
