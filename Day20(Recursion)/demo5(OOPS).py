# OOPS --> Object oriented programming System

# Class, object[Methods and Attributes]
#        object[Behaviour and State]

# Python is an object-oriented programming language. This means that almost all the code is implemented using a special construct called classes.
# A class is a code template for creating objects.
#
# What is a Class and Objects in Python?
# Class: The class is a user-defined data structure that binds the data members and methods into a single unit.
# Class is a blueprint or code template for object creation. Using a class, you can create as many objects as you want.
#
# Object: An object is an instance of a class. It is a collection of attributes (variables) and methods. We use the object of a class to perform actions.
#
#
# In short, Every object has the following property.
#
# Identity: Every object must be uniquely identified.
# State: An object has an attribute that represents a state of an object, and it also reflects the property of an object.
# Behavior: An object has methods that represent its behavior.

# A real life example:

# class Person:

# State: Name, Gender, Profession
# Behaviour : Working, Studying, Hobbies

# Using the above class, I can create multiple objects.
# object : Archana

# State:
# Name: Archana
# Gender : Female
# Profession : Working

# Behaviour:
# Working: Currently working as automation tester
# Study : Studying 2 hours a day

# object : Archana

# State:
# Name: Seetha
# Gender : Female
# Profession : Studying

# Behaviour:
# Working: Studying BTech
# Study : Studying 6 hours a day
